Merged PullRequests and commits on the `master` branch of the [[repository on GitHub|https://github.com/ustuehler/ustuehler.github.io]] are published automatically. This can take a few minutes, because the `index.html` page needs to be rebuilt by [[Travis CI|https://travis-ci.org/ustuehler/ustuehler.github.io]].

An easier way to publish your changes rapidly from within ~TiddlyWiki is described in the PublishingFlow. For that you need commit access to your fork of the GitRepository.
