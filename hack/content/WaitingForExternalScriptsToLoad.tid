type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When loading external resources required by TiddlyWiki plugins, we want be able to verify that the external resources have finished loading before we start using them.

In case of external JavaScript resources, this is simply because the code is otherwise unavailable, and users don't like it when random errors about undefined symbols pop up in their face.
