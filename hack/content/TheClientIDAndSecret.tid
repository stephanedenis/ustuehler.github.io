Reading this <a href={{!!ref}}>section of the OAuth 2.0 specification</a> made me create the FirebasePlugin to be able to store protected data in it, like a GitHubAccessToken, because the client secret really isn't supposed to be exposed, like //really// it is not.

Anyone who has the client secret can "impersonate" your application, and do whatever they like to your users, but in your name.
