The plugin's [[startup|$:/plugins/ustuehler/github/modules/startup.js]] module gets executed after the core's [[miscellaneous startup logic|Startup]].

This means that other parts of this plugin could already be executing as well, unless care is taken. Therefore, ''I don't want UI components to call plugin code directly''; they should rely entirely on event handling and messaging.
