''[[FirebaseUI]]'' is an open-source JavaScript library that provides customisable bindings on top of the [[Firebase SDK]] to eliminate boilerplate code and to promote best practices.

The only part of ~FirebaseUI that this plugin exposes is the sign-in flow, if there even are other parts to it.  (As of late 2017, only authentication seems to be implemented in ~FirebaseUI.)

This plugin loads the ~Firebase and ~FirebaseUI assets from a CDN, so it makes TiddlyWiki not be fully self-contained anymore.  However, the plugin's functionality should degrade gracefully if there is no Internet connection, without causing an overall bad user experience.
